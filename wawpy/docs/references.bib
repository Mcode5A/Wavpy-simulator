abstract = {Review of several recent ocean surface wave models finds that while comprehensive in many regards, these spectral models do not satisfy certain additional, but fundamental, criteria. We pr    opose that these criteria include the ability to properly describe diverse fetch conditions and to provide agreement with in situ observations of Cox and Munk [1954] and Jähne and Riemer [1990] and Ha    ra et al. [1994] data in the high-wavenumber regime. Moreover, we find numerous analytically undesirable aspects such as discontinuities across wavenumber limits, nonphysical tuning or adjustment para    meters, and noncentrosymmetric directional spreading functions. This paper describes a two-dimensional wavenumber spectrum valid over all wavenumbers and analytically amenable to usage in electromagne    tic models. The two regime model is formulated based on the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) in the long-wave regime and on the work of Phillips [1985] and Kitaigorodskii [1973] at the high wave    numbers. The omnidirectional and wind-dependent spectrum is constructed to agree with past and recent observations including the criteria mentioned above. The key feature of this model is the similari    ty of description for the high- and low-wavenumber regimes; both forms are posed to stress that the air-sea interaction process of friction between wind and waves (i.e., generalized wave age, u/c) is     occurring at all wavelengths simultaneously. This wave age parameterization is the unifying feature of the spectrum. The spectrum's directional spreading function is symmetric about the wind direction     and has both wavenumber and wind speed dependence. A ratio method is described that enables comparison of this spreading function with previous noncentrosymmetric forms. Radar data are purposefully e    xcluded from this spectral development. Finally, a test of the spectrum is made by deriving roughness length using the boundary layer model of Kitaigorodskii. Our inference of drag coefficient versus     wind speed and wave age shows encouraging agreement with Humidity Exchange Over the Sea (HEXOS) campaign results.},

abstract = {Since 1996 when GPS reflected signals were purposefully acquired, an effort to assess the utility of these signals has been under way. It was early determined that the reflected GPS signal can be related to ocean surface wind dependent slope probability densities. Quantifying that relationship has resulted in considerable data taken at wind speeds below those associated with tropical storms. During the 2005 hurricane season, data were taken in high wind speed conditions that have been used to compare with the U.S. Navy's COAMPS model. The gridded data were used to develop a calibration for high wind speeds which also represents a measurement of apparent ocean surface slopes at L-Band. This paper presents the results of this GPS surface reflection calibration for winds up to 35 meters per second. In addition a simple function is developed that models the mean square slope variation with surface wind speed and includes winds above 35 meters per second. This model is applied to data from Hurricanes Dennis and Isabel to demonstrate the ability of surface reflected GPS signals to yield good retrieval performance for winds at and above tropical storm strength.},

abstract = "Signals of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) bi-statically reflected off pristine dry snow in Dome-Concordia, Antarctica, were collected during an experimental campaign with the aim of investigating the potential capabilities of these signals to remotely sense dry snow areas. The data have been used to sense the sub-surface structure of the snow by means of a new holographic observable. The obtained reflected signals present interferometric patterns consistent with the coherent superposition of signals reflected in different layers of the snow sub-structure, down to a few hundred meters depth. A forward model has been developed to compare the amplitude and phase behavior of the interferences with the data. A new radio-holographic observable is also defined, to help identify the layer at which the internal reflections occur. This work represents the first step towards the potential use of a space-based GNSS-R mission for densely monitoring the depths of Antarctica's thick dry snow; and/or complementing L-band radiometric observations."
