*WAVPY* is a library for simulating and processing GNSS Reflectometry signals
and other sources of opportunity. It has been developed by the remote sensing
team and the Institute of Space Science (ICE-CSIC) and the Institut d'Estudis
Espacials de Catalunya (IEEC).

The library is written mainly in C++ and Fortran and it is compiled as a
dynamic library. That means that a main program can be linked to it to make
use of its functionalities.
Wavpy has also a python 3.0 interface so that instead of linking it 
from a C++ or Fortran main program it can be called from python 3.0 scripts.

Currently, the library has only been tested on Linux platforms (Ubuntu 18.04),
although plans exists to make the library work on other operating systems
such as Windows.

Follow the instructions in the [Installation](@ref installation) document to
install the library on your computer.
